**This FastAPI application defines an API endpoint that calculates the factorial of a given number.**

The application creates an API using FastAPI.
It defines a GET endpoint:
GET /factorial/{starting_number}
When a user enters a number (starting_number), the function calculates its factorial using a while loop.
If the number is 0, it returns False instead of 1 (which is an unusual behavior for factorial).
The result is returned as JSON output.
