**Laboratory Activity 2: Working with HTTP actions and API parameters**

**short description**
- This activity demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using FastAPI that allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on a user database.
  
**objective of the activity**
- Understand how to build a REST API using FastAPI.
- Learn how to use **query parameters**, **path parameters**, and **request bodies** in API endpoints.
- Implement CRUD operations for user data management.

**How to run the code**
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7+ recommended).
2. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
3. Save the provided Python script as **main.py**.
4. Run the FastAPI server with this code: **uvicorn main:app --reload**
5. Open your browser and navigate to the FastAPI interactive docs: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs"
6. Use tools like **Postman, cURL**, or the interactive docs to test the API endpoints.


**Expected output**
